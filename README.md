# DevC Bali Talks
Talk proposals and discussion

We're trying something different and using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints)

After each meetup, we (or the speaker) will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.
